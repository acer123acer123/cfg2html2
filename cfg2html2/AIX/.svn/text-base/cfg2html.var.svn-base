# The variable includeNAinHTML should be set to yes or no.  
# This variable determines if the command section (title, command, and output) 
# will show up in the HTML output file when the command does not produce any
# output. Examples of when this could happen include trying to run a command
# that doesn't exist.
#
# It should be noted, however, that the output of the command will still show
# up in the error file. 
# 
# Here is what the HTML output file would look like if
# includeNAinHTML="yes"
# and the following was in the configuration file:
# exec_command "iDoNotExist.sh" "I am not a command"
#
# <begin html snippit>
#
# I am not a command
# iDoNotExist.sh
# n/a or not configured!
#
# <end html snippit>
# 
# Setting this variable to "no" will surpress these unnecessary messages.
includeNAinHTML="yes"
